 Hello ELA Rice,

If you need a break from eating turkey and watching football in the next few days, take a look at the following opportunities:

1) A great summer research opportunity search site is from the Institute for Broading Participation, Pathways to Science at
http://www.pathwaystoscience.org/programs.asp?descriptorhub=SummerResearch_Summer%20Research%20Opportunity

There are many different ways to search for summer opportunities:
* browse all
* level of study, institution, and discipline
* browse by geographic region

2) For those not signed up already, the BCB Opportunities is a great Owlspace site that posts opportunities (summer programs, internships, research opportunities, graduate schools, etc.) as they become available to the Biochemistry and Cell Biology coordinators.  Even if you're not a BCB major, there are many postings relevant to all STEM students.  Join under Owlspace Membership. 

3) Title:            Summer Research Opportunities Program

5) The UNCF / Merck Science Initiative awards scholarships and fellowships at three levels:

UNCF/ Merck Undergraduate Science Research Scholarship Awards are intended to help African American undergraduate students who are interested in science to further their science education and potentially pursue science and engineering careers.  The UNCF /Merck awards provide tuition support and opportunities for research experience in a state-of-the-art research facility.  Awards up to $30,000. At least 15 scholarship awards will be granted in 2012. Each award provides up to $30,000, which includes up to $25,000 towards tuition, room and board, and billable fees.

UNCF /Merck Graduate Science Research Dissertation Fellowships will help African American graduate students complete coursework, conduct research, and prepare the dissertation required for a doctoral degree in the biomedically relevant life or physical sciences and engineering.  Awards up to $53,500. At least 12 dissertation fellowships will be awarded in 2012. Each fellowship provides up to a maximum of $53,500, which includes a Stipend of up to $43,500 for the Fellow and a Research Grant of up to $10,000 to support the research needs of the Fellow.

UNCF /Merck Postdoctoral Science Research Fellowships are intended to provide support to African American post-graduate students to obtain postdoctoral training and to prepare for a career in biomedical research.

Take care,
Alice
